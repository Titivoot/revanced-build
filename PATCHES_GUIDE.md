# Customizing ReVanced Builds

**Please read the following information before beginning.**

By default the script will build ReVanced with ALL default* patches. Edit `patches.txt` to customize your build of ReVanced.

*Default: All patches except those which have to be ***included*** explicitly, i.e, using the `-i` flag while manually using the ReVanced CLI

## !IMPORTANT!
1. Each patch name MUST start from a NEWLINE AND there should be only ONE patch PER LINE
2. DO NOT add any other type of symbol or character, it will break the script! You have been warned!
3. Anything starting with a hash (`#`) will be ignored. Also, do not add hash or any other character after a patch's name
4. Both YT Music ReVanced & YT ReVanced are supported
5. DO NOT add `microg-patch` to the list of excluding patches.
6. `patches.txt` contains some predefined lines starting with `#`. DO NOT remove them.

## Example
Example content of `patches.txt`:

- Exclude pure black theme and keep `create` button:
```
amoled
disable-create-button
```

- Exclude patches for both Music & YouTube (order doesn't matter)
```
amoled
exclusive-background-playback
disable-create-button
premium-heading
tasteBuilder-remover
```

- Include patches for both Music & YouTube (order doesn't matter)
```
compact-header
hdr-auto-brightness
autorepeat-by-default
enable-debugging
force-vp9-codec
enable-wide-searchbar
```
